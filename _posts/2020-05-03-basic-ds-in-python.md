It’s normal for any beginner to land into confusion because of the similarity between the basic data structures used in python but you can get a good understanding of them if you compare them and use them. Don’t just read the theory part, it’s important to code and use them to gain required confidence.****

Data structures are an essential part of any programming language, be it C/C++, Java, Python, etc. Now, what is a data structure? In simple words, it’s a structure or a way to organize your given data. Your data can be Python has primarily four data structures namely: **List**, **Tuple**, **Set**, **Dictionary**. Now consider we have 4 data inputs namely: Apple, Mango, 23, 32. We can use these data structures to organize our data, starting off :

**List:**

In this data structure, we store our data inside [] brackets. List is *ordered *which means when you print your data then you would get it in an ordered manner in the console. You *can have duplicate* members in your List.

You can access the data from the index number (*note that index number can be negative as well*) and change it, i.e List objects are *mutable*.

![List are mutable](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3054/1*7VotDNP_EKbaa-jDiZ73sQ.png)*List are mutable*

Similarly, you can add, remove, sort, append, etc; data in your List using the [functions in Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_list.asp). For example to append a data in List you may use append() function.

**Tuple:**

In this data structure, we store our data inside () brackets. A tuple is *ordered*. You *can have duplicate* members in your Tuple.

You can access the data from the index number but cannot change it, i.e Tuple objects are *immutable*.

![Tuple objects are immutable](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3038/1*BF6EsU5ndXkMrFjfev8ugg.png)*Tuple objects are immutable*

Similarly, you may use other [functions in Tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_tuple.asp). For example to count the number of the appearance of your data in Tuple you may use count() function.

![count() in Tuple](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3030/1*tLGrtYh2GC2dDVIUdyTuIg.png)*count() in Tuple*

**Set:**

In this data structure, we store our data inside {} brackets. The set is *unordered*. You *cannot have duplicate* members in your Set.

![Sets are unordered in python](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3032/1*C3duuOX-BgiTTzpZosbHlQ.png)*Sets are unordered in python*

![Duplicates are not shown in Set](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3260/1*uvjcmtPoVlitkHLTAX_rNw.png)*Duplicates are not shown in Set*

You cannot access the data from the index number and change it, i.e Set objects are *immutable.*

![Set objects are immutable](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3026/1*hQYVqEKqIr6t111qfe2VFw.png)*Set objects are immutable*

Similarly, you may use other [functions in Set](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_set.asp). For example to pop a data may use pop() function.

![pop() in Set](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3036/1*t8wz4Mt322n62L5hj7zI6w.png)*pop() in Set*

**Dictionary**:

In this data structure, we store our data in pairs i.e (key, item) inside {} brackets. Dictionary is *unordered*. You *cannot have duplicate* keys in your Dictionary but you may have duplicate items in your dictionary.

![Dictionary is unordered](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3042/1*_SB-OtD0Xc3UwHFnTqGSFw.png)*Dictionary is unordered*

![Duplicate keys in Dictionary](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3042/1*mJMj8V9pKjEt1oOj64g4DQ.png)*Duplicate keys in Dictionary*

![Duplicate items in Dictionary](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3042/1*e9GYWI4ErKIbY4za6cu1dw.png)*Duplicate items in Dictionary*

You can access the data via keys and change it, i.e Dictionary objects are *mutable*. You can also use get() function to access the data from keys.

![Duplicate objects are mutable](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3026/1*8EJFtvMR-8y3FQ07JIR9yw.png)*Duplicate objects are mutable*

Similarly, you may use other [functions in Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_dictionary.asp). For example to get data may use get() function.

Hence this is a brief overview of the basic data structures that exist in python.

To gain familiarity with all these data structures make sure that you use them when required and practice them!
