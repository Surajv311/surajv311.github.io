title: Chess & Vocabulary Learnings
category: nonTechnicalArticles
---

I’ve been trying to learn and improve my chess skills—found it quite interesting lately—but I haven’t had the time to pursue it consistently.
Secondly, whenever I read articles, hear someone speak well, or watch movies, series, or listen to songs, I realize that English vocabulary is another area where I have room to grow. While I don’t think I’m a bad speaker or reader, I genuinely want to improve my proficiency in this area.
This article is my attempt to focus on the areas mentioned above, where I jot down interesting things I come across. I will continue to update this page regularly as I learn interesting stuff.

## Chess: 

| Piece      | Unicode Symbol | Notation Symbol | Point Value      | Description of Moves                                                                                |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pawn**   | ♙ / ♟︎         | *(none)*        | **1**            | Moves forward 1 square (2 on first move), captures diagonally                                       |
| **Knight** | ♘ / ♞          | **N**           | **3**            | Moves in L-shape: 2 squares in one direction, then 1 square perpendicular; can **jump over pieces** |
| **Bishop** | ♗ / ♝          | **B**           | **3**            | Moves **diagonally** any number of squares                                                          |
| **Rook**   | ♖ / ♜          | **R**           | **5**            | Moves **horizontally or vertically** any number of squares                                          |
| **Queen**  | ♕ / ♛          | **Q**           | **9**            | Combines the power of rook and bishop: moves any number of squares in any direction                 |
| **King**   | ♔ / ♚          | **K**           | **∞ (Infinite)** | Moves **1 square** in any direction; most valuable — if checkmated, you lose the game               |
