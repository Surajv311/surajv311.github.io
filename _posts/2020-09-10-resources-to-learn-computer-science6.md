Learning computer science isn't just about coding and competitive programming. It's a field that demands innovation and development. <br>
It can be in any specialization but one thing is for sure every Computer Science learner starts his journey with either Web development or App development. <br>
Youtube is the best source of learning and what's the best part? It's absolutely free! All we invest is time :). <br>
In this article, I would like to share the sources that I find useful and worth following - 

* ### Development

  * [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) It teaches web development skills and techniques in an efficient and practical manner. It covers topics from basics to advanced using the most popular and trending tech stacks.

  * [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmXmlB4-HJytD7wek0Uo97A) The purpose of JavaScript Mastery is to help aspiring developers to take their development skills to the next level and build awesome apps.

  * [Tech With Tim](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim/featured) He teaches Python Programming, Game Development, Pygame, Java Tutorials, and Machine Learning videos. 

  * [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp/featured) They are an open-source community of people who learn to code and build projects for nonprofits. They have got excellent teachers who cover almost every topic in Computer Science.

* ### Guided Projects

  * [Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbmb5IoBtHZTpYZCDBOC1CA/featured) The content varies from teaching basic languages in an efficient manner to building projects fro solidifying concepts. It covers many different programming languages like Python &  C, and topics like Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI).

  * [Ania Kub√≥w #JavaScriptGames](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw) One of the best channels to learn game development in JS through guided projects. Ania teaches you JavaScript, React, Html, CSS, and Express Tutorials in game form! She is from a financial background who has switched to tech because of her obsession with coding & her aim is to teach you how to code, not to care about how silly she looks doing it. 

* ### Coding

  * [Errichto](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBr_Fu6q9iHYQCh13jmpbrg) He is a competitive programmer who has been a finalist of multiple big programming competitions like ICPC, Facebook Hacker Cup, and Google Code Jam. His videos include explaining Algorithms, competitive programming, coding interviews. 

  * [KevinNaughtonJr](https://www.youtube.com/c/KevinNaughtonJr/featured) He's a software engineer in New York City who makes videos about coding interviews and topics related to programming.

  * [CS Dojo](https://www.youtube.com/c/CSDojo/featured) This channel is hosted by Y.K Sugi. He's an ex-Google engineer who makes videos about programming and computer science here. <br> {**To be honest, his video quality is awesome** :) }

* ### AI/ML/Maths

  * [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) Hosted by Grant Sanderson. This channel is some combination of math and entertainment, depending on your disposition. The goal is for explanations to be driven by animations and for difficult problems to be made simple with changes in perspective. <br> { **For me, this is by far one of the best channels I found when it comes to explaining this stuff!** }

* ### UI/UX Designing

  * [DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVyRiMvfUNMA1UPlDPzG5Ow) This channel is hosted by Gary. He's created close to 100 courses from graphic design to advanced frontend development. He's a very experienced course instructor. He teaches full-stack development along with tutorials related to UI/UX, Frontend Dev, Backend Dev, Graphic Design, and more!

  * [PiXimperfect](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMrvLMUITAImCHMOhX88PYQ) It's hosted by Unmesh Dinda, is a free resource for learning Photoshop and Lightroom. PiXimperfect believes in learning the concept, rather than learning the steps so that you can translate "your" imagination visually to the world.

* ### Some other channels worth mentioning

  * [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/c/programmingwithmosh/featured) <br>

  * [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia/featured) <br>

When it comes to websites, I prefer: 
* [Qwiklabs](https://www.qwiklabs.com/) 
It provides you a hands-on experience on the Google cloud platform.

* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) 
The introductory courses of this website itself are very rich in content! 

* [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) 
One of the best spots to get a good list of coding questions and interview/internship experiences.

* [CP-Algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/) 
It has got a wonderful list of the number of algorithms used in **competitive programming** with a good explanation.

* [AWS Guide (Github repo)](https://github.com/open-guides/og-aws#cloudwatch) 
A practical guide to learn about AWS Cloud Services.

I hope this has been a useful reference for every reader :)
