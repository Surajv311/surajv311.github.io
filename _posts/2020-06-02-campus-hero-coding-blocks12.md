Holla ! to all my readers.

Let me introduce myself :

My name is Suraj and I am currently a campus superhero at Coding Blocks . I’m currently pursuing my bachelor’s from VIT Vellore.

Let me explain everything from the grassroot level so that one can get a crystal clear picture.

Step 1:

To apply for the campus ambassador program check out this link: Coding Blocks Campus Ambassador Program

Step 2:

Now once you land on the website. You would see a form like this:
You can fill the required details as mentioned. I would suggest that whatever you write make sure that it is clear and prove that you are fit for this role. If you have a good grip on a particular skill you can mention that as well in your additional information.

Step 3:

Now you must wait as you may probably get a call within a week if your application is a good fit. If you follow step 2 perfectly then you can surely expect a telephonic call.

Step 4:

Now comes the interview part. You can expect the first question to introduce yourself. You may then be asked about your association with your college clubs and how active you are or how can you spread the presence of codingblocks after joining as a C.A . The questions would be very simple and you need not panic if it’s your first telephonic interview. You would soon be comfortable as the discussion proceeds. And do not worry much about language . You can speak in Hinglish :)

Step 5:

Lastly you must wait . If you had a good interview you would receive an email in a couple of days stating that you are selected.
Now you’ll have lots of learning and fun being a part of the codingblocks family.
