## Market Fundamentals

### Market Structure and Infrastructure

#### Stock Exchanges

India operates two primary stock exchanges that form the backbone of its capital markets:

- **Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE)**: Established in 1875, it's Asia's oldest stock exchange and home to the benchmark Sensex index
- **National Stock Exchange (NSE)**: Founded in 1992, it's India's largest exchange by trading volume and hosts the popular Nifty 50 index

Both exchanges operate under strict regulatory oversight and provide electronic trading platforms for seamless transactions.

#### Market Participants

The Indian stock market ecosystem comprises diverse participants, each playing a vital role:

##### Individual Investors
- **Domestic Retail Participants**: Individual investors like retail traders and long-term investors
- **Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs)**: People of Indian origin residing abroad who can invest through designated channels

##### Institutional Investors
- **Domestic Institutions**: Corporate entities and organizations based in India
- **Domestic Asset Management Companies (AMCs)**: Mutual fund companies such as SBI Mutual Fund, HDFC AMC, ICICI Prudential, and Axis Mutual Fund
- **Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs)**: International entities including foreign asset management companies, hedge funds, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds

#### Regulatory Framework

The **Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)** serves as the market regulator, ensuring:
- Fair and transparent trading practices
- Investor protection
- Market integrity and stability
- Compliance with prescribed rules and regulations

SEBI continuously updates regulations to align with global best practices and protect investor interests.

### Market Intermediaries and Account Structure

#### Essential Intermediaries

Your journey in the stock market involves three key intermediaries:

##### 1. Stockbrokers
Your gateway to market access, stockbrokers enable you to:
- Buy and sell stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds
- Access research and market insights
- Provide trading platforms and tools
- Offer advisory services

##### 2. Depositories
Financial intermediaries offering Demat (Dematerialized) account services:
- **National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL)**
- **Central Depository Services (India) Limited (CDSL)**

Both operate under SEBI regulations with virtually no functional differences. The Demat account holds your securities in electronic format, replacing the old paper certificate system (pre-1996).

##### 3. Banks
Provide the bank account for fund transfers and settlements.

#### The Three-Account System

Successful trading requires three interconnected accounts:
- **Trading Account**: Provided by your broker for placing orders
- **Demat Account**: Offered by depository participants for holding securities
- **Bank Account**: For fund transfers and settlements

All three accounts operate electronically and are seamlessly integrated for smooth transactions.

#### Clearing and Settlement

**NSE Clearing Limited** and **Indian Clearing Corporation (ICCL)** are wholly-owned subsidiaries of NSE and BSE respectively. These clearing corporations ensure guaranteed settlement of all trades, providing counterparty risk protection to investors.

### Market Timings and Sessions

Understanding market timings is crucial for effective trading and investment decisions.

#### Pre-Opening Session (9:00 AM - 9:15 AM)

This session sets the stage for the trading day through three distinct phases:

##### Order Entry Period (9:00 AM - 9:08 AM)
- Place, modify, or cancel orders for any securities
- Orders placed during this time receive priority when trading begins
- Beneficial for strategic positioning before market opens

##### Price Discovery (9:08 AM - 9:12 AM)
- No new orders or modifications allowed
- System determines opening prices through multilateral order matching
- Matches buy and sell orders based on demand and supply
- Critical for establishing fair opening prices

##### Transition Period (9:12 AM - 9:15 AM)
- Buffer time between pre-opening and normal trading
- No new orders allowed
- Existing orders cannot be modified or cancelled
- System prepares for normal trading session

#### Normal Trading Session (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM)

The primary trading session where:
- All regular transactions occur

#### Post-Closing Session (3:30 PM - 4:00 PM)

##### Closing Price Calculation (3:30 PM - 3:40 PM)
- Closing prices calculated using weighted average of prices from 3:00 PM - 3:30 PM
- Benchmark indices (Nifty, Sensex) closing values determined
- Important for next day's reference pricing

##### After-Market Orders (3:40 PM - 4:00 PM)
- Place orders for next day's trading
- Orders execute at predetermined prices regardless of next day's opening
- Provides opportunity for price discovery after regular hours
- Orders can be cancelled during early pre-opening session (9:00 AM - 9:08 AM) if needed

#### Special Trading Sessions

**Muhurat Trading**: Despite being generally closed on Diwali, the market opens for one ceremonial hour during this auspicious festival, allowing investors to make symbolic investments.

### Order Types and Trading Strategies

Understanding different order types is essential for executing your investment strategy effectively.

#### Basic Order Types

##### Market Order
- Executes immediately at the best available market price
- Higher probability of execution
- Price may vary from expected due to market movements
- Example: Placing order for ₹100 might execute at ₹105 (higher) or ₹95 (lower)

##### Limit Order
- Executes only at specified price or better
- Lower probability of execution
- Provides price certainty
- Example: Limit order at ₹100 will only execute at ₹100 or favorable price

##### Stop Loss Order
- Triggered when stock reaches predetermined price level
- Limits losses or protects profits
- Two variants:
  - **Stop Loss Market (STM)**: Converts to market order when triggered (higher execution probability)
  - **Stop Loss Limit (STL)**: Converts to limit order when triggered (execution not guaranteed)

#### Advanced Order Types

##### Cover Order
- Combination of buy order with automatic stop loss
- Provides built-in risk management
- Formula: Cover Order = Buy Price + Stop Loss

##### Bracket Order
- Most comprehensive order type
- Includes entry, stop loss, and target price
- Formula: Bracket Order = Buy Price + Stop Loss + Target Price
- Automatically exits position at either stop loss or target

##### After Market Order (AMO)
- Orders placed after market closure
- Executed when market reopens next day
- Price difference possible between order placement and execution
- Useful for capturing overnight news impact

##### Immediate-or-Cancel (IOC) Order
- Must execute immediately or get cancelled
- Partial execution possible
- Example: Order for 100 shares might execute 60 shares, cancel remaining 40

##### Day Order vs. Good-Till-Cancelled (GTC)
- **Day Order**: Valid until end of trading day
- **Good-Till-Day**: Valid until specified day
- **Good-Till-Cancelled**: Valid until manually cancelled or expiry date

#### Delivery vs. Intraday Trading

##### Delivery Trading
- Shares transferred to your Demat account
- Suitable for long-term investment
- Full payment required upfront
- Dividend and corporate action benefits

##### Intraday Trading
- Positions squared off same day
- No share delivery
- Margin trading available (leverage)
- Higher risk due to leverage
- Lower capital requirement initially

### Clearing and Settlement Process

Understanding the settlement cycle is crucial for planning your trades and managing cash flows.

#### T+2 Settlement Cycle

##### T Day (Trade Day)
- Transaction execution day
- Money debited from account immediately
- Shares not yet in Demat account
- Broker generates contract note (transaction bill)
- All charges and taxes applied

##### T+1 Day
- Exchange processes the transaction
- Shares still not in Demat account
- **BTST/ATST Trading Possible**: Can sell shares bought previous day (high risk)
- Risk: If original seller defaults, you face auction penalty (up to 20% of stock value)

##### T+2 Day
- Final settlement day
- Shares credited to Demat account
- Money settlement completed
- Transaction officially closed

##### T+3 Day
- Shares available for trading without restrictions
- Full ownership rights activated

**Important Note**: Bank or depository holidays on T+2 may delay settlement, but shares still appear in T1 holdings.

### Corporate Actions

Corporate actions significantly impact your investments and require understanding for informed decision-making.

#### Dividends

Companies share profits with shareholders through dividend payments.

##### Dividend Process Timeline
1. **Dividend Declaration Date**: Board approves dividend at Annual General Meeting (AGM)
2. **Record Date**: Company reviews shareholder register (typically 30 days after declaration)
3. **Ex-Dividend Date**: Set two business days before record date due to T+2 settlement
4. **Payment Date**: Actual dividend distribution

##### Key Concepts
- **Cum-Dividend**: Trading with dividend rights (before ex-date)
- **Ex-Dividend Impact**: Stock price typically drops by dividend amount on ex-date
- **Eligibility**: Must own shares before ex-dividend date to receive dividend

**Example**: If ITC trading at ₹335 declares ₹5 dividend, price drops to approximately ₹330 on ex-date.

#### Bonus Shares

Free additional shares given to existing shareholders in fixed ratios.

##### Common Ratios
- **1:1**: One bonus share for every share held
- **2:1**: Two bonus shares for every share held
- **3:1**: Three bonus shares for every share held

##### Benefits
- Increases shareholding without additional cost
- Makes shares more affordable for retail investors
- Maintains proportional ownership

#### Stock Split

Increases number of shares while proportionally reducing share price.

##### Mechanism
- **2-for-1 Split**: Each share becomes two shares at half the price
- **Face Value Reduction**: Reduces in same proportion as split
- **Market Capitalization**: Remains unchanged

**Reverse Stock Split**: Combining shares (negative indicator for company health)

#### Rights Issue

Opportunity for existing shareholders to buy additional shares at discounted price.

##### Features
- Offered below market price
- Maintains proportional ownership if fully subscribed
- Can be traded, renounced, or partially exercised
- Similar to secondary IPO for existing shareholders

#### Share Buyback

India's financial year runs from April 1st to March 31st, affecting your tax planning.

##### Important Terminology
- **Financial Year (FY)**: Year in which income is earned
- **Assessment Year (AY)**: Year in which taxes are filed
- **Example**: FY 2023-24 income filed in AY 2024-25

#### Tax Participation Context

Only about 5% of India's 130+ crore population files income tax returns, with less than 1.5% actually paying income tax. This compares to over 45% in developed economies like the USA, highlighting the growth potential of India's formal economy.

### Alternative Investment Avenues

## Market Jargon

### Basic Trading Terms

#### Position Management
**Square Off**: The action of closing an existing position by executing an opposite transaction. Think of it as completing a trade cycle - if you bought shares, you square off by selling them, and vice versa.

**Long Position**: When you buy and hold securities expecting their price to rise. You're "long" on optimism about the asset's future performance.

**Short Position**: When you sell securities you don't own (borrowed through your broker) expecting their price to fall. You profit when you can buy them back at a lower price to return to the lender.

#### Price Reference Points
**Last Traded Price (LTP)**: The most recent price at which a stock was traded. This gives you a real-time snapshot of market valuation and serves as the starting point for your next trade decision.

**52-Week High/Low**: The highest and lowest prices a stock has reached in the past year. These levels often act as psychological barriers and reference points for investors to gauge whether a stock is expensive or cheap relative to its recent history.

**All-Time High/Low**: The highest or lowest price a stock has ever reached since it began trading. Breaking these levels often signals significant market events or company developments.

**OHLC Data**: Open, High, Low, and Close prices that summarize a stock's price movement during a specific time period (day, week, month). This data helps you understand the trading range and price volatility, forming the basis for technical analysis.

#### Trading Mechanisms
**Volume**: The number of shares traded during a specific period. High volume often indicates strong interest and conviction in price movements, while low volume suggests uncertainty or lack of interest.

**Upper Circuit/Lower Circuit**: Price bands set by exchanges that limit how much a stock can move up or down in a single trading session. These circuits prevent extreme volatility and give investors time to react to news. When a stock hits an upper circuit, it can only move up to that level, and when it hits a lower circuit, it cannot fall below that price.

### Market Conditions and Sentiment

#### Bull and Bear Markets
**Bull Market**: A period of rising prices and optimistic investor sentiment. Like a bull that attacks by thrusting upward, prices move higher. Bull markets are characterized by strong economic fundamentals, high employment, and investor confidence.

**Bear Market**: A period of declining prices and pessimistic sentiment. Like a bear that attacks by swiping downward, prices fall. Bear markets typically involve economic uncertainty, rising unemployment, and widespread selling pressure.

### Financial Performance Metrics

#### Company Fundamentals
**Topline**: A company's total revenue or sales figures, appearing at the top of the income statement. This represents the company's ability to generate business and market share.

**Bottomline**: The net profit after all expenses, taxes, and costs have been deducted from revenue. This appears at the bottom of the income statement and represents the actual money the company earned for shareholders.

**Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: Net profit divided by the number of outstanding shares. This metric helps you understand how much profit each share represents. A higher EPS generally indicates better profitability per share, but it should be compared with industry peers and historical performance.

#### Stock Performance Indicators
**Alpha**: Measures how much a stock outperforms or underperforms compared to a benchmark index like Nifty or Sensex. A positive alpha means the stock performed better than the index, while negative alpha indicates underperformance.

**Beta**: Measures a stock's volatility relative to the overall market. A beta of 1 means the stock moves in line with the market, above 1 indicates higher volatility, and below 1 suggests lower volatility than the market.

### Investment Strategies and Concepts

#### Trading Approaches
**Momentum Investing**: A strategy that involves buying securities showing upward price trends and selling those showing downward trends. This approach assumes that trends will continue in the short term, riding the wave of market sentiment.

**Tax Gain/Loss Harvesting**: A strategic approach to minimize tax liability by timing the sale of investments. For gains, you can sell investments just before they exceed the tax-free threshold and reinvest immediately to reset the cost basis. For losses, you can book losses to offset future gains, effectively reducing your tax burden.

#### Investment Returns
**Dividends**: Regular payments companies make to shareholders from their profits. Think of dividends as your share of the company's success. There are two ways to earn from investments: capital appreciation (stock price increase) and dividend income (regular payments).

**Capital Appreciation**: The increase in an investment's value over time. This represents the difference between what you paid for an asset and its current market value.

### Taxation Framework

#### Capital Gains Tax Structure
**Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) Tax**: Applied to profits from stocks held for more than one year. Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) on shares and equity-oriented mutual funds in India are taxed at a 12.5% rate (plus surcharge and cess) if they reach Rs. 1.25 lakh in a fiscal year. 

**Short Term Capital Gains (STCG) Tax**: Applied to profits from stocks held for one year or less. Currently, short term capital gains on shares are taxed at a rate of 20% under Section 111A with effect from 23 July 2024.

#### Dividend Taxation
Since April 2020, dividends are taxed as per your income tax slab rather than being tax-free. 

### Monetary Policy and Economic Indicators

#### Interest Rate Framework
**Repo Rate**: The rate at which the Reserve Bank of India lends money to commercial banks. When RBI increases repo rates, borrowing becomes expensive, reducing money supply and potentially slowing economic growth. Stock markets typically react negatively to repo rate increases.

**Reverse Repo Rate**: The rate at which RBI borrows money from banks. This tool helps RBI absorb excess liquidity from the banking system.

**Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)**: The percentage of deposits that banks must maintain with RBI. Higher CRR reduces money available for lending, tightening liquidity in the economy.

#### Banking Metrics
**Credit to Deposit Ratio (CD Ratio)**: Measures how much of banks' deposits are being lent out. A higher ratio indicates aggressive lending, while a lower ratio suggests conservative banking practices. This affects credit availability and economic growth.

#### Economic Health Indicators
**Inflation**: The sustained increase in general price levels. India typically targets inflation around 4-6%. Moderate inflation indicates healthy economic growth, while high inflation erodes purchasing power and can negatively impact stock markets.

**Index of Industrial Production (IIP)**: Measures the performance of India's industrial sector, including manufacturing, mining, and electricity. It provides insights into economic activity and industrial growth trends.

**Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)**: A leading indicator of economic health based on surveys of purchasing managers in manufacturing and services sectors. A PMI above 50 indicates expansion, while below 50 suggests contraction.

**Consumer Price Index (CPI)**: Measures inflation by tracking changes in prices of goods and services consumed by households. This directly impacts interest rate decisions and monetary policy.

### Government Securities and Safe Investments

#### Treasury Bills
Short-term government securities with maturities of 91, 182, or 364 days. These are considered the safest investments as they're backed by the government. They're sold at a discount to face value and redeemed at full value, with the difference representing your return.

**Example**: A 91-day treasury bill with face value ₹120 might be available at ₹118.40. After 91 days, you receive ₹120, earning ₹1.60 as profit.

### Understanding Market Indices

#### What is an Index?
A stock index represents a group of shares that collectively indicate the performance of a sector, exchange, or economy. Think of it as a representative sample that tells you how the overall market is performing.

**Examples**:
- **Nifty 50**: Represents the top 50 companies by market capitalization on NSE
- **Sensex**: Represents 30 large-cap companies on BSE
- **Bank Nifty**: Represents banking sector performance

Indices serve as benchmarks for mutual funds and help investors understand market trends without analyzing individual stocks.
