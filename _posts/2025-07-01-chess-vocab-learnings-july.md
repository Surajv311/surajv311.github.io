title: Chess & Vocabulary Learnings - July
category: nonTechnicalArticles
---

I have been trying to learn/improve my Chess skills (I have found it to be quite interesting recently), but haven't found the time to do so. 
Secondly, when I read articles, see someone speaking well, or watch movies, series, songs, I realize, this is an area (english vocab) where I have scope to learn and improve. Although I think I am not a bad speaker/reader, I really want to improve my stats in this area. 
This article is an attempt to do so, where I jot down interesting things.
