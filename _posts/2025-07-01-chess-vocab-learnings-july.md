title: Chess & Vocabulary Learnings - July
category: nonTechnicalArticles
---

I have been trying to learn/improve my Chess skills (I have found it to be quite interesting recently), but haven't found the time to do so. 
Secondly, when I read articles, see someone speaking well, or watch movies, series, songs, I realize, this is an area (english vocab) where I have scope to learn and improve. Although I think I am not a bad speaker/reader, I really want to improve my stats in this area. 
This article is an attempt to do so, where I jot down interesting things.

- Chess: 

| Piece      | Symbol | Point Value      | Description of Moves                                                                                |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pawn**   | ♙ / ♟︎ | **1**            | Moves forward 1 square (2 on first move), captures diagonally                                       |
| **Knight** | ♘ / ♞  | **3**            | Moves in L-shape: 2 squares in one direction, then 1 square perpendicular; can **jump over pieces** |
| **Bishop** | ♗ / ♝  | **3**            | Moves **diagonally** any number of squares                                                          |
| **Rook**   | ♖ / ♜  | **5**            | Moves **horizontally or vertically** any number of squares                                          |
| **Queen**  | ♕ / ♛  | **9**            | Combines the power of rook and bishop: moves any number of squares in any direction                 |
| **King**   | ♔ / ♚  | **∞ (Infinite)** | Moves **1 square** in any direction; most valuable — if checkmated, you lose the game               |
